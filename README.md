# GRL_mini_project
Anonymous GitHub repository to store code as evidence for the Graph Representation Learning mini-project

Code is mostly in ppi_gat_rni.ipynb, with some graph generation also in visualisation.ipynb

Trained models get saved to a folder called best_models - statistics on their runnings are made available, but not the models themselves as the download task was too cumbersome.
